## What is a (digital) common ?

----

### A common is...

Always 3 things:
1) **People** that share the common (community / society)
2) A **resource** that is being produced (shared / consumed / maintained)
3) A **framework** to establish how the common is produced (governance)

Example: Nature (:droplet:, :dash:, :herb:), Infrastructure (city), Knowledge (:books:)

## Evolution of the commons

----

### Long ago :fire:

### A few centuries ago :european_castle:

----

### Today :rocket:

----

### Today

- liberalism: private slowly replaces public sector
- capitalism adoption of the commons: sharing economy (Airbnb, Uber), but without the governance

---

## Social / Political aspects

----

### Goals & issues

Commons vs Private
- Counterbalance the privatization of knowledge & resources
- Hard to fight big digital monopolies (more regulations needed)
- Not enough support from the public sector :money_with_wings:

Internally
- Lack of diversity (male dominated space, usually tech / educated profiles)
- Requires collaborative skills :open_hands:

----

### Future prospects

Closer ties with the public sector :school:
- Reduce dependency of public with private sector
- Develop local economy and communities, political/governance skills
- Co-creation of public policies (increase democracy participation)

Don't forget that technology is a tool and not a solution

----

### What about the private sector ?

Balancing 'for the customer' and 'for good'
- current framing: “customer is king” and the government (often an industry regulator) is what stands in the way of a corporation’s ability to serve her
- dedicate some time or the product/service for public interest
- find bigger problem to solve, rather than protect the business model that has delivered in the past
- innovation vs human progress

---

## Takeaway

If there is no commons, there is no market

Change of mindset: consume less, share more :smiley:
